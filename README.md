# Purpose of the satellite
The main objective is to create a device for learning purposes with sesnsors, which montiros it's current environmental parameters. The implementation should carry the possiblity to later expand the functionality and design to make a fully functional launch ready CubeSAT.

# Requirements:
<br/> - Must be around 1kg
<br/> - It must use the 1U configuration (10x10x10 cm)
<br/> - Must use only 3.3V and 5V bus voltages
<br/> - Must comply with CDS and ECSS (The machanical design is an exception since for hobby usage it will be made out of PLA)

## TODO list
- [ ] Define requirements fully
- [ ] Choose components
- [ ] Implement sensor functions
- [ ] Implement telemetry
- [ ] Implement power management
- [ ] Create a mechanical design
- [ ] Createa a PCB design
- [ ] Assembly + testing
